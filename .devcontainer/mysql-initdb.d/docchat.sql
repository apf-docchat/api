The Foundation does extensive and deep on-the-ground work across the country – both directly and through partners.  The Foundation\'s direct work is carried out through its district-level Field Institutes which have a deeper reach through block-level presence. It is also building a network of university campuses to contribute to capacity development and research for the social sector. The first Azim Premji University was set up in Bangalore in 2010, and the second one in Bhopal will be operational in 2023.  A substantial part of the Foundation\'s direct work is to help improve the public (government) school education system in India, prioritising the more disadvantaged areas of the country. This work ranges from teacher capacity and leadership development to matters of policy and curriculum.  Centrality of teachers  Teacher effectiveness is critical for good quality education, both experience and research from across the world and our own, reaffirm this. Our work on the ground is hence, significantly focused on the professional development of government school teachers. Our teacher professional development work covers all school subjects and includes content, pedagogy, and perspectives. At a more specific level, it is informed by the needs of specific cohorts of teachers with whom we engage through multiple modes.  Language and Maths Literacy and numeracy are the foundation on which children\'s achievements in successive classes depend significantly. It is at this basic level that many children in schools are found struggling. As a result of this, they do not benefit from the time they spend in the school system and for them, the promise of education remains largely unfulfilled. It is to address this situation that a significant part of our current work is towards building the capacities of primary (class 1-5) school teachers.  Handbook for Language Teaching  This handbook has been developed to facilitate our work with primary school teachers in the area of Language Teaching. It is based on our experience of working closely with public schools and teachers for over two decades. It has also benefited from the experiences of other institutions.  This handbook can be used as a practical guide for anyone working with teachers with the same objective of improving language teaching up to class 5.  This handbook details \'classroom practices\' for effective language teaching. Teachers who know how to and who consistently implement these practices in their classrooms are, in most contexts, able to help their students attain literacy.  Structure of the handbook There are three chapters in this handbook.  The first chapter sets the context and situates our approach to the work with teachers in improving language teaching in public schools. It begins by explaining how children learn a language (or languages) at home; what learning a second language at school entails and the kind of challenges we see on the ground. It goes on to identify some broad practices that must be followed in a classroom for effective language teaching and learning. It also, briefly, talks about important aspects of language teaching which need to be conceptually clear to the teacher.  The second chapter revolves around classroom teaching-learning processes. It describes in detail the desired classroom teaching practices that make teaching effective. These practices are anchored in some basic language teaching processes, such as using poems and stories, posters, talk, print-rich environment etc. There are classroom examples of how to work with particular content, what the usual mistakes are and how to avoid them or find solutions. Generally, teachers teach with the help of textbooks, so references from textbooks have been taken to demonstrate how these can be transacted creatively.  The third chapter lays out the approach and process of working with teachers. It is a \'need-based\' approach in which the \'need\' is identified using \'desirable teaching practices\' as a reference through direct observation of classroom teaching as well as interactions with teachers and students. Basically, if specific \'desirable practices\' are not being practised by teachers, these become their \'needs\'. Teachers having similar needs are then grouped to form cohorts and an engagement plan is formulated and executed around those needs. The engagement plan constitutes a variety of modes, such as focused short sessions, workshops, sharing of selected reading material, onsite support etc. Our continued engagement with teachers informs us whether our work with them is leading to the desired \'effects\'. The chapter explains this process in detail. Any organisation which is working with teachers to bring about desirable changes in their pedagogical practices at the school level will find this useful.  Our experience suggests that working with teachers on a large scale would require materials other than this handbook for comprehensive capacity-building in this domain. Additional supporting materials, such as workshop modules, session plans, lesson plans, worksheets, videos, and other Teaching Learning Materials (TLM), will be available with the digital version of this handbook.  We hope that teachers, those working with teachers, and others interested in school education will find this handbook useful.',0,1,4),(3,'Chapter 1 overview','Chapter 1 - Our Approach to  English Language Teaching Overview of Chapter 1 This chapter will help us build an understanding of the following: 1. How children acquire their home language(s) and learn English as a second language. 2.  Principles of second language learning that must be kept in mind while working in the area of English language teaching. 3.

Larger issues in the context of English teaching in India. 7. An overview of our 6 desired classroom practices for English language teaching at the primary level. 8.  Our guiding principles for working with teachers.  We are born with an innate potential to learn languages. Each child, irrespective of race, religion, caste, class and background, comes to school with a command of oral language (often their home language(s)) and certain abilities to make sense of and use language for various purposes. The purpose of the school is to turn this potential into fully functional abilities which will help the child deal with the day-to-day challenges of living in a social set-up, acquire and construct knowledge and understand concepts in various subjects. The use of children\'s home language(s) in the early years of schooling, therefore, has cognitive and academic advantages for children. This is the language in which they have developed their initial understanding of the world!',1,1,4),(4,'Acquisition of Home Language(s)','When a child is born, she is completely dependent on her caregivers. She cannot immediately speak and cries for all her needs. But she is not left alone till she grows up and becomes self-sufficient. She is surrounded by family members, neighbours and friends who interact with her, hold her, play with her, and at the same time, using the home language(s) also interact with one another in a wholesome way, including complete words and sentences. This steady and meaningful interaction provides rich language inputs to the child who has the natural urge to communicate and discover the world around her. She begins to babble, smile, reach out and grasp, etc. She listens to the different sounds and the tone/style of using these sounds by listening to people as they converse, sing, laugh or argue. The child slowly starts paying more attention to the language(s) and notices the difference between various sound patterns, as well as the similarities and contrasts in their sequence. Her utterances become clearer and more intelligible over time as she grasps and acquires the language(s) she grows up hearing. The child makes many deviations from the conventional patterns of uttering words and communicating because both, her vocal apparatus and her brain, are developing. Notwithstanding all these imperfections in the child\'s language(s). she is appreciated and applauded for her efforts. In this playful and encouraging environment, the child gradually acquires the language(s) through an unconscious process, without much correction or intervention by the parents and others. She gradually picks the conventional usage of language and drops her earlier, unconventional language forms. In a multilingual country such as ours, children are generally exposed to more than one language at home or in their close surroundings because of which they easily acquire these languages. For example, if the child\'s parents speak Hindi but her grandparents speak Marwari, and they all converse with one another using a mix of Hindi and Marwari, the child will effortlessly “pick up” and use both these languages. Initially, she may not even know that these are different languages! As the child grows up, she may notice at some point that she uses a lot more Marwari with her grandparents and more of Hindi with her parents and siblings – this does not happen through a conscious choice but seems to be rather automatic. The Hindi spoken at home may also be very different from the Hindi used in the neighbourhood/market or the standard Hindi which is taught in schools. Another situation could be where the home language completely differs from the common language spoken outside. For example, if the family migrates to Ahmedabad, the child will “pick up” Gujarati from her interactions with friends in the neighbourhood or at school. If children have access to technology, they also pick up many words from TV shows, YouTube videos, online/mobile games, etc. The necessary condition is that there should be enough exposure to these languages in the environment and meaningful engagement with them. There is sufficient evidence that children are not just good at acquiring many languages simultaneously in the early years, but are also very cognizant (aware) of where and when to use these languages for various purposes. ',2,1,4),(5,'Second Language Learning: Some Important Observations','The process of language learning is the same whether it is the home language(s) or the second language(s) (here, English), provided a few conditions are met – the learner gets adequate comprehensible input in English which she is able to partly make sense of, is regularly involved in English communication in a non-threatening environment, is allowed enough time to produce utterances in English and the emphasis is largely on meaning-making. · The input in English (either provided by the teacher or through exposure to different material/content) does not immediately result in the use or production of English by the learner. As in the case of home language(s), learners need sustained exposure to English without any pressure to produce the language. During this period, in which the learners are outwardly \'silent\', a lot of language learning takes place, which is not immediately apparent. Learners repeatedly listen to the sounds, structures, tone/style, etc. and prepare themselves to produce these at a later stage. There are many debates about the \'silent period\' but it can be accepted that learners should not be expected to produce English immediately after being exposed to it. ·  The errors made by the learner in the process of learning English reflect the developmental stage of the learner and are often self-corrected when the learner moves to the next stage. For example, a learner who generalizes the pluralization rule of adding \'-s\' will learn through exposure that some words, like \'childs\', \'childrens\' and \'peoples\', do not exist in English. A common assumption is that learners must first master the structure (syntax) and rules of English (grammar) to become fluent. We know this to be untrue as we regularly see children and grown-ups picking up languages from their friends, TV or books without being aware of the grammar of the language. This proves that meaning making happens before the mastery of structure. It is pertinent to note here that self-correction takes place even in the case of home language(s). However, heightened awareness of the rules of grammar may impede the acquisition process.  Contrary to common belief, language(s) already learnt (home languages) do not interfere with the acquisition of more languages, like English. If we notice learners using the rules of their home language(s) in English, it happens because they have not yet acquired the rules of English. They are not yet ready to produce English but if they are forced to produce it, they use the known rules as a compensation strategy. For example, learners may use words in sentences like \'Where are my bookein?\' or \'I cricket play\'. This may also be seen in pronunciation, for example, emphasizing the \'-ed\' sound in words like \'talked\' and \'danced\' or the \'-r\' sound in words like \'sir\', \'father\', and \'mother\'. The overall tone/style of speaking is also influenced by the known languages. Exposure to English improves the accuracy of the language, especially in terms of structures and vocabulary. For many decades now, pronunciation and tone/style influenced by the home language(s) of the speaker are not considered unacceptable by language experts, as a variety of \'Englishes\' is used all over the world! Language learning happens best in a low-anxiety environment where the learner is motivated and has a certain degree of confidence.',3,1,4),(6,'Principles of Second Language Learning','A	Every child has an innate potential to learn languages We are born with the potential to learn language innate potential Children come to school with a certain command of at least one oral language  their home language and certain abilities to make sense of and use it for various purposes The purpose of the school and the teacher is to turn this potential into a fully functional ability This goes a long way in helping them deal with the daytoday challenges of living in a social setup acquire and construct knowledge and understand concepts in various subjects It should however be kept in mind that children may differ in their pace of learning languages B	Bilingualmultilingual approach in English classrooms In early years of schooling the use of childrens home languages has advantages for the child as her initial understanding of the world around is shaped through her home language In this sense childrens home languages needs to be looked at as a resource for formal classroom teaching and not as that which interferes or hinders the learning of new languagessubjects However this does not mean that all English texts should be directly translated It simply means that one or two languages that are spoken in that region are used in the classroom along with English for conversation and discussions           	For example a child who speaks Marwari and some Hindi at home looks at the picture of a village and identifies many objects persons and actions in her known languages She even talks about the picture with her friends and independently describes it in front of the class But she is not able to do all this in English yet The teacher allows the child to use her home languages and supplements the childs responses using a mix of Marwari Hindi and a few keywords in English for example house tree shop dog and bus The teacher points at the picture when using these English words in Marwari and Hindi sentences or questions for example Picture mein kyakya dikh raha hai Shop kahaan hai Kitne tree hain Dog ka colour kya hai Sabse favourite animal kaunsa hai Tell me Iss picture mein five cheezein count karo jo tumhein sabse acchi lagi Unke baare mein kuch batao In sab cheezon ko apne gaon apne village mein dekha hai This gives children a lot of meaningful exposure to English The teacher does not force the child to produce English but encourages her to slowly use a few English words of her own The teacher encourages the child with questions like  What is this word called in your language I will ask the question in English but you can answer in Marwari or Hindi or both This enables the child to know that English is just another language and is not learnt at the cost of forgetting languages she already knows The teacher also develops awareness of sounds phonological awareness using sounds from the childs home languages she does this exercise orally and does not write down anything on the board for example  word mein se  hata doge toh kya bachega Tumhari bhasha mein aur kaunse words mein  sound hai Kya basketball aur bathroom mein  sound hai C	Skills acquired during learning one language are transferred while learning another language Language and thinking skills acquired in the home languages get transferred across the languages learnt later This is even seen at home when a child acquires more than one language For example a child who knows Hindi from her parents will most likely acquire Marwari from her grandparents when they move into the same household She may generalize many unconsciously acquired rules of Hindi grammar pronunciation to Marwari or unconsciously draw parallels between the two languages This process becomes more conscious in formal settings like school For example the child may think about the wordorder of Hindi and how it differs from English while being taught English by the teacher Being corrected by the teacher or indulging in selfcorrection can also throw up such opportunities Generally such transfers of skills are perceived as a hindrance or interference by English language teachers without considering their immense potential to aid learners New learning builds upon existing learning In the case of teaching English in the primary schools in our field contexts it is better to draw some parallels between languages without resorting to direct translation This can be done for example by introducing the English counterparts of familiar objectspeople in the surroundings and using short English greetings in daily life This will further build language familiarity and comfort to learn English Transfer of advanced language and thinking skills also takes place For example knowing how to organize ones thoughts summarize a text or use reading strategies in one language help in the newly learnt language as well D	Oral language exposure is the foundation of language learning Oral language forms the foundation for learning to read and write the language It is important to create a variety of experiences and opportunities for using oral language in the language class Such exposure should include the childs knowledge and experience of the world outside school For example the use of conversation around pictures poems and stories improves childrens ability to engage with the content completely and articulate their thoughts clearly  E	Skills of listening speaking reading and writing are interlinked and should be taught simultaneously The skills of listening speaking reading and writing should not be seen and taught as separate skills because they are interconnected and cannot be developed in isolation This is not to say that one or a few skills cannot be the focus during a class For example the teacher could initially focus more on oral exposure to English while tellingdiscussing a story and later introduce a story chart or big book to help children identify words To read more about the interconnection of all skills refer to the note in section 213 page 47 A note on the connection between oral language oracy and reading and writing literacy F	Developing language skills across the curriculum  The use of English in the school curriculum cuts across different subjects mathematics science EVS etc and learning situations morning assembly midday meal sports etc This also contributes to language learning In other words the learners learn not only different subjects along with learning to think but also develop a greater knowledge and use of English  its vocabulary and structures Therefore all teachers and not just the language teacher have an important role to play in the teaching of English The English Syllabus for Classes at the Elementary Level by NCERT 2006 prescribes a thematic package in line with the cognitive level interest and experience of learners It adds Since all contemporary concerns and issues cannot be included in the curriculum as separate subjects of study some emerging concerns like environmental issues conservation of resources population concerns disaster management forestry animals and plants human rights safety norms and sustainable development should be suitably incorporated in the course content G	Teach the language not its rules or content Teachers must make the learners experience language rather than make them learn it by rules An example of this is the teaching of grammar The objective of the teacher is to help learners develop grammatical awareness where she would be able to identify similar structures in any form of content Therefore making children aware of grammatical concepts is a better idea than first teaching them rules of grammar 	For example a teacher may ask children to circle the names of characters in each story and then find all instances of he and she She can talk about who is being referred to in each instance and give more examples of he and she to help children figure out their meaning and use The teacher knows that she is teaching these two pronouns but does not explicitly call them so until much later She can later use assessment tools like a worksheet oral questions from any text eg a story or even a language game where children have to make sentences using he and she for their friends in class using different contexts given by the teacher H	Explicit teaching of soundletter correspondence phonics is required for children to learn a language It is evident that exposure to written and oral languages is crucial to language learning Our experience in the field also supports the fact that children do not learn to read and write scripts solely by being immersed in rich literate environments They need systematic teaching of the script Many students especially those with limited exposure to print appear to need explicit and systematic teaching of soundletter correspondence phonics and word study throughout the elementary grades in order to learn to decode language fluently Therefore while we must provide children with good childrens literature rich conversations and discussions the explicit and systematic teaching of phonics word study practice of script and word knowledge are crucial I	Assessment as a part of the pedagogical process If the teacher weaves the process of assessment into that of teaching itself she can routinely get an idea about the individual progress of each child and plan her work accordingly Even if the progress is marginal it would motivate the learner to do better This goes a long way in improving the learners selfesteem as they learn English For instance if the teacher involves her learners in group tasks that require thinking discussion as well as drawing reading writing and craftwork each learner will be able to do something or the other While children are busy talking and working in their respective groups she can take rounds and appreciate as well as give critical but positive feedback to the individual learner about their contribution in the group For this she can use a combination of assessment tools like observation monitoring the childs engagement and use of English checklists how many steps of the activity does each child follow rubrics to what extent is each child using English while speakingwriting etc Assessment in our context is therefore primarily meant for the teacher to understand the issues faced by individual learners in the course of learning English  A note on teaching English in a multilingual classroom exploring comprehensible input code switchingmixing and the Bilingual Method Our multilingual context India is a linguistically rich and diverse country The Eighth Schedule of our Constitution lists 22 official languages including Bodo Dogri Maithili Meitei Manipuri and Nepali Even so we all know that the actual number of languages spoken in our country is far greater The 2011 census saw a total raw return of 19569 mother tongues  a staggering number for even a large country such as ours This means that it is very likely for an average Indian to have exposure to more than one language in their home environment and to therefore know and comfortably use more than one language in their daily lives Multilingual learners and the double divide We are a nation of multilinguals and developments in neuroscience have proven that knowing more than one language either as a bilingual or a multilingual sculpts the brains architecture Bilingualsmultilinguals have longterm cognitive advantages in not just learning more languages in future but also in a host of cognitive functions Despite these insights from science we cannot ignore the debates of language vs dialect standard vs nonstandard language and mothertongue vs foreign language Multilinguals naturally have social advantages too Despite the near universal spread of English as a common tongue it continues to exert its influence as the language of status power and access These have serious implications on the way languages are viewed taught and learnt Let us imagine a young child Rinku in a small village of Pindwara in Rajasthan who speaks a mix of Marwari and Vaagdi Rinku picks up a few words and phrases of Gujarati when he travels with his father to Ahmedabad each year He also picks up bits of Hindi from his neighbours and friends When Rinku grows up he realises that the Hindi he knows is very different from the Hindi being taught in school English also becomes one of the many languages he encounters in life and his multilingual mind is very equipped to learn English but this does not happen Not only is Rinku forbidden from speaking his home languages in school he is also taught English using a strict grammartranslation method that is completely disconnected from his life and experiences This is because it is often believed that the childs home languages interferes with the learning of English The divide Rinku experiences is commonly referred to as the double divide a term coined by Ajit Mohanty to explain the double divide between English the regional dominant languages and the tribal minority languages Unfortunately this double divide often results in the loss of ones own languages as the cost of learning a standard regional language or English Erasure of language in the classroom is effectively the erasure of ones culture and identity What do the experts say The Position Paper on the Teaching of English refers to English as a global language in a multilingual country The paper notes the different Englishes spoken in the country and acknowledges the variety of English language teachinglearning experiences depending on the exposure to English children have outside school and the English teachers own proficiency in the language The Paper recommends a multilingual approach to teaching English where the childs home languages are seen as a resource and not as an interference in the learning of English The Paper clearly states that the barriers that exist between languages need to be broken and that the barriers between languages themselves and other subjectsdomains need to be broken down as well This is because the content of any language be it stories fiction nonfiction authentic material etc is borrowed from real life and from different subjectsdomains This is a languageacrossthecurriculum perspective and can be discussed separately The National Curriculum Framework 2005 and the Position Papers recommended the drafting of national benchmarks for learning We got these in the form of Learning Outcomes at the Elementary Stage Secondary Stage and the Higher Secondary Stage At the elementary stage particularly in the early years the learning outcomes clearly state that children in an English classroom should initially be given the space to respond nonverbally through scribbles and drawings andor in their home languages Even in the later years at the secondary stage the learning outcomes clearly expect learners to use their bilingual and multilingual abilities to comprehend a text and participate in bilingual and multilingual discourses The English classroom is envisioned as a space where the multilingual backgrounds and abilities of learners are respected and appreciated What does a multilingual classroom look like Acknowledging and giving space to the multilingual identity of learners has serious implications on the way English is taught in classrooms and this is not just in higher grades but also in the primary and upper primary grades Imagine a classroom where the English teacher makes concerted efforts to include childrens home languages and simultaneously develops their engagement with English How can this be done What are the challenges How do children actually learn English in a multilingual setting To understand this let us revisit what we mean by comprehensible input Comprehensible input and its guiding principles The term comprehensible input was coined by Stephen Krashen2 in his theory of second language acquisition that is widely known and accepted Let us not get confused by second language or third and \r\nfourth language and understand second language to mean English Comprehensible input is the language input in the second language that is one step beyond the childs current stage of linguistic competence This comprehensible input is commonly referred to as i1 where i is the learners current stage of language and 1 is the next stage of language development Krashen calls comprehensible input a necessary ingredient for the acquisition of language The rationale of comprehensible input is that it provides learners the comfort of understanding the language while also posing a certain degree of challenge This challenge motivates the learner keeps them interested and defines the scope of acquiring language The Position Paper on the Teaching of English recommends using comprehensible input in meaningful language learning contexts both inside and outside the English classroom with due space given to the childs home languages This means that the form that comprehensible input takes in our contexts is not just familiar English with a few unfamiliar words and phrases in English but a mix of familiar English the home languages and the challengeposing unfamiliar English This distinction is of critical importance because the origin of Krashens comprehensible input is in whole language classrooms of America where Spanishspeaking children had ample exposure to English in their surroundings and in their English classrooms if not at home A challenge that teachers in our contexts encounter in their attempt to provide comprehensible input is their lack of familiarity with the home languages of children This problem may not be everywhere but is likely to be more common in larger states where the language spoken by the teacher who is from a faroff district or even a neighbouring state is completely different from the languages spoken by children It is important to note here that the teacher does not have to be fully proficient in all languages spoken by children in their school that is neither possible nor expected Developing a working vocabulary of words and phrases in the home languages of the learners will be more than sufficient as we have already agreed that comprehensible input is a blend of familiar languages with the unfamiliar The teacher is also not expected to work alone but in conjunction with other staff members the community and the richest resource of all  the children  who will slowly begin to produce utterances in English and already bring a treasure of language with them to school Comprehensible input in our contexts will give adequate exposure to English without resorting to direct translation and will lay the foundation for developing a foundational competence in the language Providing comprehensible input in meaningful language learning contexts is therefore the guiding principle of helping children learn English in the initial years Here it is also important to note the silent period hypothesis which states that learners do not immediately begin to produce the second language but first go through a period of silence During this time the comprehensible input provided to learners is of vital importance Nonverbal responses and utterances in the form of pseudoproduction of language will slowly give way to more utterances in English and these are reflected in the way the learning outcomes for the early years have been defined  The bilingual method of teaching English You must have heard of code switching and code mixing Simply put code mixing is when someone uses one word or phrase from one language while using another language Code switching is when the language is arranged structurally and grammatically in other language The terms are generally used interchangeably even by experts to signify the mixing of elements from two languages Code mixing and switching occur naturally when there are two or more speakers who know both the languages in question and no direct translation takes place We do it and our teachers do it too In our contexts mixing the elements of familiar languages with the addition of English can be an important tool that the teacher can consciously use for providing comprehensible input In many of the illustrations given under the 6 Classroom Practices you will find examples of code switching and mixing used by not just the teacher but also the learners as they begin to slowly respond using a mix of languages The bilingual method by itself is a very specific method of teaching a foreign language here English that was developed by CJ Dodson in the 1960s as a response to the other popular methods of teaching English at the time particularly the audiovisual method the direct method and the grammartranslation method It is not recommended to follow the bilingual method in the form that was envisioned by CJ Dodson It should be clear that using the childrens home languages as a resource in the classroom is to give space to all languages through bimultilingual conversations in the form of comprehensible input and diverse bimultilingual material in meaningful language learning contexts both inside and outside the classroom Pedagogical strategies and materials in a multilingual classroom The Position Paper on the Teaching of English recommends providing diverse inputs including textbooks big books parallel materials in more than one language media support and authentic material that is naturally available in the environment like menus pamphlets visiting cards advertisements hoardings etc These are not just storebought but can easily be coconstructed with children inside the classroom with low material costs material Bilingual storybooks and picture dictionaries Stories from the textbooks can be converted to make bilingual stories in the form of big books where children play an integral role in illustrating captioning and binding the books Bilingual picture dictionaries can be developed by talking to children and the community and finding out words from the home languages that are commonly used in daytoday life Children can again be involved in illustrating captioning and binding the dictionaries Support from the community can also be taken thereby building a strong connect between the school and community Both bilingual storybooks and picture books add to the print material of the classroom and are low cost They can be revisited time and again to develop print awareness build childrens engagement with print and introduce the script  a massive challenge in the English classroom It is better when material is coconstructed with children in the classroom A word of caution regarding bilingual material  like any printed material it is important to not just place the material in the classroom but also build childrens engagement with the material A word of caution bilingual material should not just be placed in the classroom but need to be leveragedused in activities to build the childrens engagement with them The suggested readings mentioned at the end of this article and the illustrations given under the 6 Classroom Practices provide interesting ideas for building this engagement Bilingual conversations We have seen ample examples of bilingual conversations in our illustrations given under the 6 Classroom Practices Bilingual conversations employing code switching and mixing has the power of providing comprehensible input to learners while also expecting them to produce some language The conversations can be built around topics that interest children like their daily routines a story or a picture or any other available input While the bilingual conversations can initially be completely oral the teacher can begin writing what children say on the board or on a pasted chart paper The teacher can gradually begin to paraphrase what children say in complete English and tell it back andor write it down on the boardchart paper This can be done at a juncture where most of the children in the classroom are largely comfortable with more and more use of English by the teacher even if they themselves are not yet ready to use complete English i1 Illustration Day 1 Dalpat teaches English at a primary school in Khamnor block of Rajsamand district He has attended a few inservice programs where he became acquainted with using bilingual conversations and resource material in class like charts flashcards storybooks and dictionaries During his preservice STC he had studied how primary school children should be gradually introduced to English through reallife examples and situations Dalpat is a young teacher and he is fairly comfortable with English He knows that he does not have a very diverse vocabulary and that he sometimes struggles to make grammatically correct sentences but he believes that he can help his children learn even more English than himself On a typical day Dalpat talks to his children about their morning Today there is a flurry of activity as children enter school Dalpat talks to a few children and finds out that they witnessed a hilarious scene of a tiny dog barking at a camel on their way to school Children who come to school from another route are equally interested to know what happened Dalpat immediately seizes this opportunity to make an English story in class II and III today they both sit together in one class After the assembly Dalpat takes all the children inside the classroom He starts with a familiar Hindi rhyme Oonth chala bhai oonth chala hiltadulta oonth chala Everyone mimics the walk of a camel and uses actions while singing Dalpat Very good Aap sab ne bohot acche se sing kiya Par batao aaj humne ye wali rhyme kyun sing ki hai What is the reason Kamala Sir aaj wo subahsubah hum Peepalki gali se aa rahe the na tab humne ek oonth ko dekha Ek chotta sa kutta uspe bhonk raha tha A few children chip in and say different variations of Ek dog ek camel par barking kar raha tha Dalpat Oh So a dog was barking at a camel Dalpat writes this sentence on the board and reads it aloud He does fingerpoint reading and asks children to join him as he reads the sentence once again Children in Dalpats classroom have become used to this routine They say something using a bit of English but Dalpat writes it fully in English and reads it aloud The children are quite curious to see how things they say are written in English At the same time they feel comfortable to share in whatever language they know even English To read short sentences and words Dalpat refrains from doing fingerpoint reading and reads directly This has helped his children become more fluent in reading over time and rely less on using their fingers Dalpat Kiskisne dekha A dog was barking at a camel Raise your hands Almost half the class that comes from Peepalki gali raises their hands Some children also say Yes Sir Raise your hands is a phrase that children in Dalpats classroom have become accustomed to Dalpat uses a show of hands very often during his conversations He notices that two children who earlier used to respond only nonverbally have also said Yes Sir today This is a huge development and Dalpat is very happy He calls out the names of these two children Dalpat Arrey waah Very interesting Par hum baki sabne toh kuch nahi dekha Bataoge kya hua What did you see Khushbu and Akram Akram and Khushbu start talking together and Dalpat asks Akram to speak first Yes Sir Humne dekha Wo ek oonth na aiseaise chal raha tha aur ekdum se ek uske saamne ek chotta sa kutta aagaya aur wo kutta itni zorzor se bhaunk raha tha aur oonth na ekdum aise Each time Dalpat paraphrases and writes what children say and reads it out  first by himself and then with children Some children struggle to read or are listening to a few words or phrases for the first time but they benefit from reading together To encourage children Dalpat makes a few of them read individually too but he does not force anyone to read After Khushbu and many more children narrate what they saw this is what the board looks like For the first sentence children enact a variety of ways in which camels walk A camel was walking aiseaise It was tall and brown in colour just like other camels Suddenly a small dog came in front of the camel It was jet black in colour The dog barked and barked at the camel The camel got scared It turned and ran away Dalpat quickly writes the sentences on strips of paper and erases the board He gives the sentence strips to different groups of children and asks them to arrange them in the correct sequence Sometimes he cuts each sentence strip into two and children match the strips to complete the sentences The class III children are more comfortable with reading The class II children mainly observe and arrange the strips as per the instructions given to them by their older classmates They are beginning to read By the time this activity is done children have already gone through the English narration of the morning incident several times Dalpat Very good Now do you think humein ek storybook banani chahiye Remember humne ek storybook read ki thi Kya name tha uska Many children speak out the name of the book Sir Ranganna Wo elephant tha Dalpat asks a few children to retell the story briefly in their own words They do it in their own language Dalpat So should we make a storybook about the tall camel and the small jet black dog Aap drawing karoge Theres an uproar in the class Do you think and Should we are pet phrases of Dalpat and he uses them when the class as a whole needs to make a decision Kamala Sir humne wo camel ki tasveer bhi banai thi na Dalpat Arrey waah You remember Tinku Aur bhi bohot sare animals ki tasveer bhi banai thi Sir Dalpat Can you show me Kamala and Tinku Children immediately rush to the window where some picture cards are kept in a basket Can you show me is a classroom routine that Dalpat has established in all his classrooms The moment he says it children immediately know that they have to find out or point at something in the classroom Kamala picks out the camel picture card from many others It has a handdrawn image of a camel on both sides One side says Camel in English and the other says Oonth in Hindi written in Devanagari script Dalpat asks Kamala to show the card around As it is time to end the class Dalpat announces that tomorrow they will pick up from where they left off Day 2 Dalpat begins the second day with the same rhyme Oonth chala bhai oonth chala Children were already anticipating this rhyme so they begin the moment Dalpat enters the classroom Dalpat asks a few children to rearrange the sentence strips from the previous day and he copies the sentences on the board Dalpat These are the sentences we wrote yesterday Humne baat ki thi ki hum ek storybook banaenge Kya use aaj banae There are resounding yesses from the room A few children are especially excited because they love to draw and colour Dalpat asks two children to go to the staff room and bring back the treasure box The treasure box is filled with an assortment of sketchpens broken crayons of various shapes and sizes pencils erasers etc Children always look forward to being picked out for carrying the treasure box Dalpat Ab dekho before we start making our storybooks thodi planning kar lete hain Pawan Sir planning kyu karni hai Aise hi bana lete hain na Dalpat Planning toh karni padegi Nahi toh sablog same drawing banate rahenge We should plan Tell me sabse pehle sentence ke liye kaunsi drawing banani chahiye What should we draw Kailash A camel is walking Dalpat Yes but how should we make the camel Wo camel ka picture card lana jo Kamala ne dikhaya tha Haan ye dekho What does the camel look like Bhavana Sir ye tall hai lakdo rang ka hai long neck hai iski Kushal Long long fourfour legs hain iske Bhavana Aur ye greengreen leaves khata hai na aiseaise Dalpat plans how each page of the storybook can be designed by talking to children and incorporating their suggestions',4,1,4);

Fast R-CNN is capable of training the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, and it\'s 213x faster at test time, achieving a higher mean average precision (mAP) on the PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmark. Notable features include multi-task training that jointly optimizes classification and bounding-box regression, and a streamlined process without the need for disk storage for feature caching. The paper also discusses aspects like scale invariance, achieved through single-scale training or image pyramids, and the efficient use of object proposals to improve detection accuracy. Fast R-CNN was implemented in Python and C++ using the Caffe framework and is publicly available under the MIT License. Experiments on the VOC07 dataset reveal that Fast R-CNN, with its multi-task training and the use of the softmax classifier, surpasses the R-CNN and SPPnet performance. The architecture\'s capability to fine-tune all network layers, including the conv layers, is crucial for its high performance, particularly with very deep networks like VGG16.','[\"What is Fast R-CNN and how does it improve object detection?\", \"How does Fast R-CNN compare to R-CNN and SPPnet in terms of speed and accuracy?\", \"What are the innovations introduced in the Fast R-CNN method?\", \"How does the Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer contribute to Fast R-CNN\'s performance?\", \"What are the key advantages of Fast R-CNN over previous object detection methods?\", \"What is the role of multi-task loss in Fast R-CNN\'s training?\", \"How is scale invariance achieved in Fast R-CNN?\", \"Is Fast R-CNN capable of updating all network layers including convolutional layers?\", \"What datasets were used to evaluate Fast R-CNN, and what were the results?\", \"How does Fast R-CNN make use of object proposals?\"]','[\"1.

To overcome this, the paper proposes a semi-supervised object detection system that uses a small number of seed bounding box annotations and a larger scale of image-level annotations. This system is based on a training-mining framework, widely used in weakly supervised object detection tasks, with innovations to counteract inherent labeling noises, which include false negatives, inaccurate boundaries, and false positives. The authors introduce NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN) with three key features: an ensemble of two classification heads and a distillation head to combat overfitting and improving mining precision; masking negative sample loss in the box predictor to mitigate false negative labels; and training the box regression head solely on seed annotations to avoid inaccuracies from mined bounding boxes. They evaluated NOTE-RCNN on ILSVRC 2013 and MSCOCO 2017 datasets, where it consistently improved detection accuracy with iteration between mining and training steps, topping the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, the ensemble of classification heads in both the proposal and detection stages, alongside the utilization of knowledge distillation from pre-trained source category detectors, helps in achieving robustness against label noise. By integrating human annotations with the iterative process, the team believes further improvement can be achieved.','[\"What is the NOTE-RCNN?\", \"Why is labeling a large number of bounding boxes challenging?\", \"How does the training-mining framework work in weakly supervised object detection?\", \"What are the types of noise in mined bounding boxes?\", \"How does NOTE-RCNN tackle issues with noise in labels?\", \"What datasets were used to evaluate NOTE-RCNN?\", \"How does NOTE-RCNN perform compared to standard Faster RCNN?\", \"What innovations does NOTE-RCNN bring to semi-supervised object detection?\", \"How does knowledge distillation improve the performance of NOTE-RCNN?\", \"What future work did the authors propose?\"]','[\"1.

Revenue decline factors include e-diversion of First-Class Mail, recession impacts, and substitution to Standard Mail. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) of 2006 introduced constraints like CPI-capped price increases and significant RHB pre-funding requirements. USPS\'s financials saw a notable shift from a net income of $0.9 billion in FY2006 to a loss of $3.8 billion in FY2009, emphasizing the critical impacts of RHB pre-funding, revenue decline, and limited cost-saving options. Projections from the report suggest volume declines will steepen, driven primarily by reduced First-Class Mail, with total potential losses reaching $238 billion by 2020 under a \'Base Case\' scenario without strategic intervention. In response, USPS can pursue productivity improvements, workforce flexibility, and product innovations within its control to potentially reduce annual losses to $15 billion by 2020. However, to achieve sustainability, \'Fundamental Change\' involving legislative adjustments is deemed essential. These changes include modifying service levels, revising pricing caps, enhancing workforce flexibility, and shifting public policy frameworks like RHB funding mechanisms. In the short term, options like RHB restructuring and debt limit adjustments are critical to prevent statutory financing violations projected for October 2010.

This initiative, in partnership with Majdoor Adhikar Manch, focuses on construction workers, primarily in Ahmedabad, engaging over 900 workers and their families affected by occupational hazards. PTRC, since its inception in 1992, has made significant strides in addressing occupational health diseases in Gujarat\'s hazardous industries, bringing this expertise to the construction sector. The initiative seeks to enforce legal compliance within the construction sector, given the sector\'s high accident rates, largely overlooked due to the workforce being primarily Dalit, tribal communities, and migrants. This proposal aims to remedy the lack of accountability from employers in ensuring workplace safety, a gap identified due to the construction industry\'s workforce nature. Financially, PTRC\'s proposal involves expenses largely focused on program objectives (99% of the grant), with a minor portion allocated to administration costs (1%). Despite PTRC\'s high dependency (165%) on the grant, the Foundation recommends this grant based on PTRC\'s commitment, grassroots presence, and satisfactory financial management.

The Society for Door Step School was founded in 1989 by Rajani Paranjpe and Bina Lashkari in Mumbai and expanded to Pune in 1993. Its mission has been to address education challenges faced by vulnerable children, and it has since established various educational programs including 50 creches, 11 community learning centers, and 9 school-on-wheels. Their target demographic includes very young children (aged 6 months to 3 years, and where necessary, children aged 3-6 years), pregnant and lactating mothers at construction sites, brick kilns, and sugar mills. They aim to provide early childhood care, education, and nutrition, improve health conditions of pregnant and lactating mothers, and enroll workers into social security schemes. The annual spendings for the past years have been averaging 10.73 Crore INR, with funders including corporate social responsibilities (CSRs), direct and indirect donations, and grants from other foundations and government. The proposed program involves the establishment and operation of creches, measuring children\'s health metrics, linking women to health care resources, and running sensitization campaigns about social security schemes. They plan to affect an estimated 3,300 children and 500 women directly. Financial planning includes budgets for program salaries, travel, fixed assets, and administrative costs, ensuring 92% of the grant is directed towards program costs. The Society for Door Step School has established credibility with a good track record, validated by its long-standing partnership with Wipro Cares and other donors, and demonstrates sound financial hygiene and statutory compliance.

With a new grant of 0.50 Cr INR over three years, Mitr Sanketa aims to protect 5000 workers by promoting unionization and legal support, and linking 1000 workers to social security schemes. The project, extending to 7 new slums, relies on a combination of outreach, sensitization, collective formation, legal aid, and awareness campaigns. The budget includes costs for personnel, administration, campaigns, and meetings. Currently, funding comes from Kolar Gold Fields Women’s Association and Sewak, with a 67% dependency rate.

It underlines that only 6% of new rental construction is affordable for households earning at or below 50% of the area median income, against a need of 49%. Furthermore, housing development costs surged by 11.0% and 9.5% in 2021 and 2022 respectively, exacerbated by high interest rates. The document elucidates the nuanced nature of cost containment, including the trade-offs involved in using lower-quality materials or siting developments in less expensive locations, which might lead to increased maintenance or reduce residents’ access to amenities. The goal is to finance high-quality, green, accessible, and reasonably cost-effective housing. For multifamily developments, the report reveals that average total development costs (TDC) have been consistently around $266,000 per unit over the last decade and a half, after adjusting for inflation, despite policy changes that could have increased costs. It mentions strategies such as assessing cost reasonableness through a predictive cost model, addressing systemic cost drivers like local policies or financing complexities, and exploring innovative construction techniques like off-site construction to contain costs. In single-family housing, median costs reflect reasonable and consistent standards compared with industry benchmarks, with new construction median costs at $470,000 in the metro and $276,000 in Greater Minnesota.

Besides producing research results, the effort also develops new procedures and finds solutions for new conceptual problems. We first briefly review the basic experimental techniques in this domain; then we discuss some specific experimental issues, such as the specimen preparation problems caused by peculiar features of the techniques, e.g., their surface sensitivity.

In order to detect it, radiologists need to inspect multiple Computed Tomography (CT) scans. This task is tedious and time consuming. In recent years, promising methods based on deep learning object detection algorithms were proposed for the automatic nodule detection and classification. With those techniques, Computed Aided Detection (CAD) software can be developed to alleviate radiologist’s burden and help speed-up the screening process. However, among available object detection frameworks, there are just a limited number that have been used for this purpose. Moreover, it can be challenging to know which one to choose as a baseline for the development of a new application for this task. Hence, in this work we propose a benchmark of recent state-of-the-art deep learning detectors such as Faster-RCNN, YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet and EfficientDet in the challenging task of pulmonary nodule detection. Evaluation is done using automatically segmented 2D images extracted from volumetric chest CT scans.\",\n  \"introduction\": \"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Lung Cancer is the most common cancer worldwide with 2.09 million cases diagnosed in 2018. This cancer is considered the leading cause of deaths due to cancer with 1.76 million deaths in 2018. This is mainly due to tobacco use considered as the most important risk factor for cancer with approximately 22% of cancer deaths. In the USA, researchers estimate about 228,820 new cases and 135,700 deaths in 2020 alone. This is more than the numbers predicted for colon, pancreas and prostate cancers combined with 53,200 47,050 and 33,330 deaths, respectively. However, early detection and treatment has been proved to be effective in reducing the risk of fatalities. There are two components of early detection, early diagnosis and screening. Nowadays, one of the most accurate way to manually diagnose patients is using low dose of chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans.

To reduce the dependence on expensive bounding box annotations, we propose a new semi-supervised object detection formulation, in which a few seed box level annotations and a large scale of image level annotations are used to train the detector. We adopt a training-mining framework, which is widely used in weakly supervised object detection tasks. However, the mining process inherently introduces various kinds of labelling noises: false negatives, false positives and inaccurate boundaries, which can be harmful for training the standard object detectors (e.g., Faster RCNN). We propose a novel NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN) object detector to handle such noisy labels. Comparing to standard Faster RCNN, it contains three highlights: an ensemble of two classification heads and a distillation head to avoid overfitting on noisy labels and improve the mining precision, masking the negative sample loss in box predictor to avoid the harm of false negative labels, and training box regression head only on seed annotations to eliminate the harm from inaccurate boundaries of mined bounding boxes.

However, the application of deep learning-based detectors is still limited by the efforts of collecting bounding box training data. These detectors are trained with a huge amount of manually labelled bounding boxes. In the real world, each application may require us to detect a unique set of categories. It’s expensive and time-consuming to label tens of thousands of object bounding boxes for each application. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised object detection setting: learning an object detector with a limited amount of labelled bounding boxes (e.g., 10 to 20 images with fully labelled bounding boxes) as well as a large amount of image-level labels. We adopt a training-mining framework to handle labelling noise and propose NOTE-RCNN, which incorporates an ensemble of classification heads for both box predictor and region proposal predictor to increase the precision of the mined bounding boxes, masks the negative sample loss in box predictor to handle false negatives, and only trains the regression head with seed bounding boxes to avoid inaccurate boundaries of mined boxes.\",\n  \"related_work\": [\n    \"Weakly supervised object detection\",\n    \"Semi-supervised object detection\"\n  ],\n  \"method\": \"We propose a sequential training-mining framework to first initialize a target detector using seed bounding box annotations, then perform box mining using image-level labels to refine the detector, and finally re-train the detector using both mined and seed boxes.
